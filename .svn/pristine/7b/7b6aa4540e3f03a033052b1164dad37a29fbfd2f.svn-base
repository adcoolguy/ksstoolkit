	<div>You have visited a page where we show you how SCI Widget (as example for FiOS TV platform) is developed.  The concept is simple, we developed it component by component at the highest level, and layers by layers within each of the component.</div>
	<iframe src="VerizonFiOSTV.htm" width="704px" height="480px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">

	<div style="position:absolute;left:715px;top:100px">
		Take two of the components we developed as examples, the core framework component and the "List" component.<p>
		&larr; This is core component. You can click on any part of it to let it has the focus, and use Left and Right arrow key just like on the TV remote. It is not a screen cast or Adobe Flash magic, it is a real (JavaScript) application!!!<p>
		It is built using platform specific language, native to the TV platform. In the case of Verizon FiOS, it is in LUA. In this show case, it has been developed using HTML 5 and JavaScript. As our tool in the development depends on JVM (for instance 
		LuaJava bridge as in the case of FiOS), this HTML 5 component depends on Java applet to achieve the similar purpose.<p>
		Thus, you need an HTML 5 browser, with JavaScript turned on, as well as granted Java Applet access to view this component and try out its basic functionalities properly.

	<iframe src="List.htm" width="704px" height="480px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0">
		This browser does not support iframe
	</iframe>
	<div style="position:absolute;left:715px;top:780px">
		&larr; This is a "List" component. It is the most complicated component ever built by us or we dare to say for anyone on a TV platform, especially true on any TV platform. It may looks simple, but it consist of over a thousand lines of code, just to achieve a similar functionality like a scrolling list UI on a web platform that everyone takes it for granted.
		Similar in every aspect technically, you can click on any part of it to let it has the focus, but do use Up and Down arrow key to scroll up and down, just like on the TV remote.
